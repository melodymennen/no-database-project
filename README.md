# Daily Projects - No Database Project

## Overview
I was tasked with creating a no database project in two days. What I made is an app that keeps track of links to our daily projects. 

## Current Features:
- display links to daily projects
- mark projects as 'in progress' or 'complete'
- search through links
- connect to a third party API (Giphy) to display a random gif

## Tech:
I used many technologies when making this project including but not limited to: React | JavaScript(ES6) | NodeJS | ExpressJS | CSS
