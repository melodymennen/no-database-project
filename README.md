# Daily Projects - No Database Project

## Overview
I was tasked with creating a no database project in two days. What I made is an app that keeps track of links to our daily projects. 

## Setup:

* `Fork` and `clone` this repository.
* `cd` into the project directory.
* Run `yarn`.
* Start the server with `nodemon`.
* Start the web dev server with `yarn start`. In your browser, open `http://localhost:3000`.

## Current Features:
- display links to daily projects
- mark projects as 'in progress' or 'complete'
- search through links
- connect to a third party API (Giphy) to display a random gif

## Tech:
I used the following technologies when making this project: React | JavaScript(ES6) | NodeJS | ExpressJS | Axios | CSS
